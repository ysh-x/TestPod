		<h2>TestPod | An automated tool for subjective answer correction</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most crucial aspects of a teaching faculty is to correct
			the answer sheets of the students. With a curriculum driven by tests
			and scoring, examinations have stood as the backbone of the education
			industry. Teaching faculty spend an enormous amount of time for
			verification and assigning the right scores to each student. This
			acts as a limitation as the faculty can focus on other aspects of
			teaching and enriching the students. <br> <br> The
			Application focuses on a novel methodology to automate the correction
			for subjective-based questions and answers using NLP Techniques.
