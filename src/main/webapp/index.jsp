    <h2>TestPod | An automated tool for subjective answer correction</h2>
    <p>
    One of the most crucial aspects of a teaching faculty is to correct the answer sheets of the students. With a curriculum driven by tests and scoring, examinations have stood as the backbone of the education industry. Teaching faculty spend an enormous amount of time for verification and assigning the right scores to each student. This acts as a limitation as the faculty can focus on other aspects of teaching and enriching the students.
	<br><br>
	The Application focuses on a novel methodology to automate the correction for subjective-based questions and answers using NLP Techniques.
